# How to customize run.prm, the run configuration file?
<small><i>Page last updated on: {{ git_revision_date }}</i></small>

The mcce program reads file run.prm from the working directory and runs according to its instructions.

The two ways that run mcce are:

1. customize run.prm and call mcce directly
2. run step1.py, step2.py, step3.py, are step4.py as wrappers of mcce.

## run.prm format
The valid parameters are defined as a key-value pair, defined by a line.

At the end of the line, the key string word is enclosed in a pair of parenthesis. The key string must be one word.

If a key is detected from a line, the first word of the line is its value.

For example:
```
f        step 1: pre-run, pdb-> mcce pdb                    (DO_PREMCCE)
```
The key is "DO_MCCE" and the value is "f".

Lines other than parameter lines are considered as comment lines, therefore ignored.

### Input and output
---
```
prot.pdb                                                    (INPDB)
```
Th parameter "INPDB" specifies a pdb file as the initial input structure.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Major mcce steps
MCCE can be divided into four steps.

blockdiag {
   A [label="Step 1\n Proof read structure"];
   B [label="Step 2\n Make conformers"];
   C [label = "Step 3\nMake energy table"];
   D [label = "Step 4\nSimulated titration"];


   A -> B -> C -> D;
}

The steps have keys:

 * DO_PREMCCE
 * DO_ROTAMERS
 * DO_ENERGY
 * DO_MONTE

The value 't' is for true (do), and 'f' is for false (not do).
```
Steps:
f        step 1: pre-run, pdb-> mcce pdb                    (DO_PREMCCE)
f        step 2: make rotatmers                             (DO_ROTAMERS)
f        step 3: do energy calculations                     (DO_ENERGY)
f        step 4: monte carlo sampling                       (DO_MONTE)
```

The later step depends on the out put of previous step.


## Less edited entries

Step 2 and step 4 have more flexibility and are customized more often than others.

### General
---
```
4.0      Protein dielectric constant for DelPhi             (EPSILON_PROT)
```
Dielectric constant of protein. Usually epsilon 8 is used for small soluble protein (~100 residues), and 4 is used for big trans-membrane protein (> 200 residues).
This value is used by step 2 to optimize rotamers and step 3 to compute energy table.

```
/home/mcce/Stable-MCCE/extra.tpl                              (EXTRA)
```
This file contains entries that overwrite those defined in ftpl and tpl files in param/ directory, and extral controls over the program.
The extra controls are in two categories:

1. offset energy of ionizable residues. These energy corrects the residue solution pKa values based on previous benchmarks.
2. The scaling factor of van der Walls energy term. The recommended values are the inverse of dielectric constant defined by EPSILON_PROT.

```
/home/mcce/Stable-MCCE/name.txt MCCE renaming rule.           (RENAME_RULES)
```
The renaming rule can

* divide a big group into separate ionizable groups.
* put ligands and cofactor as one group.

This is done by renaming the atom and residue.
