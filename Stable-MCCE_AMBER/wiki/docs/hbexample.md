<small><i>Page last updated on: {{ git_revision_date }}</i></small>

Hydrogen bond network obtained from MCCE is the hydrogen bonds existing in protein in Boltzmann distribution. The network helps reveal proton transclocation pathways, water pathways involving in the protein. The relative publication is on [Cytochrome c Oxidase](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005272818301257).

## Principle
The hydrogen bond network in MCCE is obtained from microstates in Boltzmann Distribution in Monte Carlo sampling, based on defined D-H...D distance and angle, where D is the donor atom with a lone pair.

1. Save microstates with Boltzmann Distribution in Monte Carlo sampling.
2. Calculate all possible hydrogen bonds exist between residue conformers. A hydrogen bond matrix is obtatined.
3. Coupling with microstates (Step 1) and hydrogen bond matrix (Step 2), hydrogen bonds selected in miscrostates in Monte Carlo sampling are calculated.

## Input
1. Monte Carlo sampling microstates is obtained from **energies** and **head3.lst**.
2. Hydrogen bond matrix is obtatined from **step2_out.pdb** and **head3.lst**.
3. Selected hydrogen bond network is calculated based on **hb.dat** and **microstate** file, which is in ms_out folder.

## Output
1. **pH#eH#ms.txt** under ms_out folder is generated for each pH and eH titration, where each file is named after titration point of pH and eH value following by 'ms'.
2. Hydrogen bond matrix is saved in **hb.dat** and **hah.txt**, where hb.dat is a binary file and hah.txt is a readable txt file. hb.dat has 2D matrix with N * N, where N is the total conformer number in the protein. hah.txt stores the geometry infos for each hydrogen bond. **resInHbNet.txt** contains the all residues that can be involved in hydrogen bond network. **reshbond.txt** contains all possible bonds between residues. 
3. **pH#eH#hb.txt** under hb_out folder is obtained for each pH and eH titration, where each file is named after titration point of pH and eH value foloowing by 'hb'.

## File format
1. **pH#eH#ms.txt**: 
Comment line and blank line are dismissed.
Each file starts with headers, consist of monte carlo sampling unchanged information.
Then it stores the new conformer id for each microstate, and its relative energy and times it stay at this microstate. 

- **First line**: Temperature, pH, eH values
- **Second line**: Method to get microstate. Either MONTERUNS or ENUMERATE, representing from monte carlo sampling or analytical method
- **Third line**: n_fixed, the number of fixed residues for sampling. Following are the occupied conformer ids for each fixed residue, splitted by space.
- **Fourth line**: n_free, the number of free titrated residues that can get flipped during sampling. Follwing are all conformer ids, splitted by space for each free titrated residue, splitted by semicolon.

- **For each Monte Carlo sampling**:
- **Fifth line**: order of monte carlo sampling
- **Fifth line**: n_free, following occupied conformer id for each free titrated residue. This is the starting state for the sampling. The starting state will be decided by its energy to be accpeted or not.
- **Sixth line**: Energy of microstate, counter representing times the microstate stays, new conformer ids compared to last microstate.

## Example
Here is a tutorial to calculate the hydrogen bond network using MCCE 
and to visualize hydrogen bond network using Cytoscape. 

### Parameter setting in run.prm:
1. Output microstate in MCCE step 4.
```
step 4:
t        Output Microstate from standard monte carlo        (MS_OUT)
```
2. Run Step 6 to get hydrogen bond network. 
- **"(GET_HBOND_MATRIX)"**: obtain hydrogen bond matrix from step2_out.pdb and head3.lst.
- **"(HBOND_LOWER_LIMIT)"**: setting for (GET_HBOND_MATRIX). Hydrogen bond distance lower limit.
- **"(HBOND_UPPER_LIMIT)"**: setting for (GET_HBOND_MATRIX). Hydrogen bond distance upper limit.
- **"(HBOND_ANG_CUTOFF)"**: setting for (GET_HBOND_MATRIX). Hydrogen bond angle cutoff, only angle larger than the cutoff will be considered hydrogen bond.
- **"(GET_HBOND_NETWORK)"**: obtain hydrogen bond network in Botlzmann distribution based on hb.dat and microstate file.

- Hydrogen bond donor and acceptor attom parameters are setting in **param04/hb.tpl**.
```
HDONOR   ASP01       HD1
HDONOR   ASP02       HD2

HACCEPT  ASP01       OD1  OD2
HACCEPT  ASP02       OD1  OD2
HACCEPT  ASP-1       OD1  OD2
```

Default hydrogen bond definition in run.prm is:

```
Step 6:
t        Obtain hydrogen bond matrix                        (GET_HBOND_MATRIX)
1.2      Lower limit of hydrogen bond H--B distance         (HBOND_LOWER_LIMIT)
3.2      Upper limit of hydrogen bond H--B distance         (HBOND_UPPER_LIMIT)
90.0     Angle cutoff of hydrogen bond                      (HBOND_ANG_CUTOFF)
t        Obtain hydrogen bond network                       (GET_HBOND_NETWORK)
```

3. Output file after step 6: hb.txt if final hydrogen bond network.
- hb.dat, hah.txt, resInHbNet.txt, reshbonds.txt from **(GET_HBOND_MATRIX)**.
- hb.txt from **(GET_HBOND_NETWORK)**.

### Result Analysis:
#### Cytoscape visualization:
We are using Cytoscape for visualizing hydrogen bond networks. 
Download and install [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/).

#### Input file preparation for Cytoscape:
- hb.txt: hydrogen bond network with direct hydrogen bond between residues/waters, which is the direct output after MCCE.
- out.dat: aggrageted hydrogen bond network coupling with water for multiple hydrogen bond networks, which needs post-analysis based on hb.txt.
> #### Steps to get out.dat:
> **Inputs**: 
> - Multiple hb.txt files: rename them as 1.dat, 2.dat, 3.dat etc.
> - Residues_list.lst: residues list selected.
> ```

> - jhead.h: water molecules cutoff represents the maximum water number allowing to bridging hydrogen bond between residues. Here 4 is  up to 4 water molecules are allowed to bridge between two residues. For example, if you want to see up to  two water bridging hydrogen bond connections between two residues, 
then you can change 4 to 2.
